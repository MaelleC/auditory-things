The rate modulation depth calculation gave interesting results. 
In fact, RMD is a measure of the precision of response,
and we found that absolute refractory period increased it only 
for a specific stimulus (pure tone). 
This in line with \cite{AvissarPapier}, 
where they found that for pure tones, refractory period uncreased entrainment 
and may increase the precision. 
For the other stimuli, the non-linear effects triggered by the sudden changes 
seems to be stronger than the effects of the refractory period and hide them.

For the second part of the project, the results were too noisy to conclude anything.
