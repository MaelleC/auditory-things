The rate modulation depth calculation gave interesting results. 
In fact, RMD is a measure of the relative precision of response,
and we found that absolute refractory period increased precision only 
for a specific stimulus (pure tone), but not generally. 
This result comes in contrast to generalizations of \cite{BerryMeister}.

For the second part of the project, more data should be calculated to conclude anything.
